Advantage:
==========
While using Openstack, users face situation where many Openstack resources (instances, networks, users, tenants, images etc) present which are not in use and should be 

cleaned up, also sometime testing tools like Tempest, CTS, creates many resources which are not cleaned up, there this tool can be useful.
'openstack_resourceclean' script cleans Openstack related resources created by any testing tool. (Example tempest)

Options:
========
1. --cleanall: Clean all the resources for all the tenants except service tenant which are used in Opensatck services, keystone entry for admin tenant will not be      

   deleted
2. Clean all with --keep-admin: clean all resources except openstack service tenant and admin resources
3. Input --config-file: clean all the resources except resources of openstack service tenant and tenants provided in input file
4. --verbose to see verbose output in console


       HOST_IP     : IP of the host where keystone is present i.e.controller
       USER_NAME   : User name of admin user (Admin of all other user)
       PASSWORD    : Password of admin user (Admin of all other user)
       TENANT_NAME : Name of the tenant who is admin of all other tenant


'openstack_resourceclean' writes logs to cleanup.log in home directory of the user
